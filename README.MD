# REACTIVE LAND

## Welcome to Reactive land,

Where we go through a journey from reactive programming to reactive systems.
Our journey will happen through a series of short lecture (Youtube) followed by an educational programming challenge.

### Who?

- If you have an overall knowledge about reactive programming but never tried it before.
- If you have tried reactive programming but it never worked

### Requirements:

- Decent Java programming skills
- Reading [Reactive manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org)

### Reading suggestions:

- [projectreactor](https://projectreactor.io/)
- Overall Understanding
  of [Webflux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html)
- Josh Long book: [reactive-spring](https://leanpub.com/reactive-spring)
- watch [video from spring](https://youtu.be/IZ2SoXUiS7M)
- [Functors, category theory and Java](https://dzone.com/articles/functor-and-monad-examples-in-plain-java)

### What

In this repo we have recordings of interactive educational shows, experiments and blog posts.

### Shows:

#### Rules of engagement during each episode:

- During each episode, after the lecture, we will work on some programming challenges.
  When you solved one (in your group or alone), feel free to create a PR.
- Master branch (called `main`), will contain challenges and their solutions.
- If you want challenges without answers, you can check out the commit id corresponding to each episode.
  Of course that commit will contain answers to challenges of previous episodes.

#### Rules of engagement after each episode:

- At this point in time, it might be hard to create merge able to master PRs due to required effort to rebase.
  So please enjoy resolving challenges in your local (checkout from commit id) branch,
  and use the current state of the master branch to verify your solutions.
